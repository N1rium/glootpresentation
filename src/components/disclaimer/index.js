        obtained from publicly available sources and has not been independently verified by the Company, GSI or Carnegie

      <Paragraph>
        Statements in this Teaser, including those regarding the possible or assumed future or other performance of the
        Company or its industry or other trend projections, constitute forward-looking statements. Forward- looking
        statements can be identified by the use of words such as “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,”
        “seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates” and “anticipates” or the negative terms or other
        comparable words, or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Examples of forward-looking statements are
        statements that concern the Company’s future plans, strategies, revenues, costs, projections and liquidity. By
        their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other
        factors because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future whether or not
        outside the control of the Company. Such factors may cause actual results, performance or developments to differ
        materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, no assurance is
        given that such forward-looking statements will prove to have been correct. Past performance does not guarantee
        or predict future performance. This Teaser should not be relied on as a promise or representation as to the
        future and does not purport to contain all of the information that may be required to evaluate any potential
        transaction and should thus not be relied on in connection with any such potential transaction.

        revise this Teaser or any forward-looking statements. None of the Company, GSI or Carnegie provide legal,
        accounting or tax advice and you are strongly advised to consult your own independent advisors on any legal, tax
        or accounting issues relating to these materials. The receipt of this Teaser by any recipient is not to be taken
        as constituting the giving of investment advice by GSI or Carnegie to that recipient, nor to make such person a
        client of the GSI or Carnegie. No person shall be treated as a client of GSI or Carnegie or be entitled to the
        protections afforded to clients of GSI, nor Carnegie solely by virtue of having received this Teaser, and
        neither GSI or Carnegie will be responsible to any person(s) other than the Company for providing such
        protections or for providing financial advice in relation to Project Boom.
